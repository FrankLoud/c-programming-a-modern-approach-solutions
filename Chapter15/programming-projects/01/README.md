Solution to "C Programming: A modern Approach" chapter 15 programming project 2

The justify program of section 15.3 justifies lines by inserting extra spaces
between words. The wya the write_line function currently works, the words closer
to the end of a line tend to have wider gaps between them than the words
at the beginning. Improve the program by having write_line alternate between
putting the larger gaps at the end of the line and putting them at the
beginning of the line.
